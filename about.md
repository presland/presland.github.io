Embedded Intelligence is a blog about Artificial Intelligence on the Edge.

I received a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics from [Bristol University](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/) where I worked on simulation software and sensor development for the [CMS](https://cms.cern/detector) dector. After joining [LHCb]() as a post doctoral research scientist I continued detector simulation and development before being awarded a [CERN Fellowship](https://home.cern/) to work on particle beam simulation for [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) beam controls. After entering industry I worked on realtime motion control for [parallel manipulator robotics](http://www.hagenbuch.ch/en/produkte/hexamove) and [vibration testing](http://www.hagenbuch.ch/en/produkte/high-performance-shaker) and as a consulting software engineer for [Embedded Systems](https://www.bbv.ch/) working on a variety of micro-controller (RTOS) and micro-processor (Embedded Linux) based solutions.

Recently I have been using AI for spatio-temporal data science using sensor data from mobile devices for [SmartMobility](https://axonvibe.com/) solutions.
